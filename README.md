# youtube-multi-view
I can create a basic website where users can enter a YouTube video URL and open multiple views of it.

The website will have:
✅ Users can enter a YouTube video URL and specify the number of views (iframes).
✅ The site will embed multiple instances of the video with autoplay enabled.
